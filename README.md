# File-Organiser-with-Node.js

This project makes uses of the in built node modules of FileSystem and Path to create a File Organising System completely built upon Nodejs. An organised folder will be created upon running this program inside the folder you want to sort. Inside that folder you'd find all your files categorized according to their type inside specific folders.

It also has an additional function of displaying the files inside a folder in a structured manner which is done using Nodejs too.
